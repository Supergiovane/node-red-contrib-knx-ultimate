The HUE nodeset has been integrated to allow anyone to link KNX and HUE in a simpler manner as possible.

The HUE nodeset is using the V2 clip API version.

In this page, you can learn how to link the things toghether. First of all, you need to have a Bridge V2 (square bridge). Then you can add it to the HUE node. The process is very straightforward.

Just set the Bridge's IP and click **CONNECT** button.

| Property | Description                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| IP       | Put here the bridge's IP (the IP must be fixed) |
| Name     | The bridge's name                               |
