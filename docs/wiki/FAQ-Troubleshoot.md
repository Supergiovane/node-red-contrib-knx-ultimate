# FAQ AND TROUBLESHOOT
_First of all, thank you to use one of my node-red nodes! I worked a lot on this node and i hope you'll enjoy my efforts in offering my work to all users.<br/>
If you're here, you may have some issues. I'm sorry about that.<br/> **Don't worry and relax ** , we'll find what your problem is, because the**knx-ultimate node WORKS** , it has about thousand installations around the world and i have it installed as well for my home. So please follow the FAQ and if you "i'm still having problem", contact me._
Be aware that the minimum **nodejs version is 16** or above.
## THE NODE DOESN'T WORK
- Do you have created the [Gateway configuration node](/node-red-contrib-knx-ultimate/wiki/Gateway-configuration) with the IP and Port pointing to your KNX/IP Router/Interface?
- If you've a KNX/IP **Router ** , you need to put in the**Host ** field, the multicast KNX IP address**224.0.23.12 ** and port**3671 ** - If you've a KNX/IP**Interface ** , you need to put in the**Host ** field, the Interface's IP address, for example**192.168.1.22 ** and port**3671 ** - If you have**two or more Ehternet interfaces ** (like Raspberry PI), either specify the Ethernet interface to use in the [Gateway configuration node](/node-red-contrib-knx-ultimate/wiki/Gateway-configuration), or totally disable the WIFI interface. Remember to**restart node-red** !
- Use only certified pure KNX/IP Router (preferable) or pure KNX/IP Interfaces. Do not use "all in one" devices, or proxies, or devices that, besides other functions, do KNX/IP routing as well. A stable connection between **LAN and KNX is the most important thing** , and it need to work. Spend money on that and you'll setup and forget it.
- If you have **an IP interface** try to disable the ACK by selecting _Suppress ACK request_ in the [Gateway configuration node](/node-red-contrib-knx-ultimate/wiki/Gateway-configuration).
- Follow the **I CAN ONLY RECEIVE TELEGRAMS, NOT SEND - OR VICE VERSA** checklist
- If you're running Node-Red in a container, **delay the start of node-red after the container boots up** . Some users report that the Ethernet card is still DOWN when node-red starts. You can try it by manually stop node-red, disabling auto start of noder-red at boot, reboot the container, wait 2-3 minutes and manually start node-red. If KNX-Ultimate works, the issue is that.
## AFTER SOME TIME THE NODE STOPS WORKING
- Read the **THE NODE DOESN'T WORK** faq.
- Check and eventually **disable** DDOS protection or UDP flood protection on your switches/routers. This as general rule. UDP KNX packets can be blocked otherwise.
- Try to directly connect your KNX/IP Router/Interface and your node-red PC.
- If you've a cheap KNX/IP Interface, specially if is an "all in onde" device, it can hangs. Go buy a real KNX/IP Router.
- If you use an KNX/IP Interface, be sure that you haven't reached the maximum connection limit (see your KNX/IP Interface's user manual). **KNX/IP Routers** are preferable instead, they doesn't have connection limits.
## KNXD CONFIGURATION
- If you're running **knxd** on the same machine of node-red, please use 127.0.0.1 as interface address, otherwise knxd will have problems.
- If you're using **knxd** , please check the filtering tables and change the KNX config-node's physycal address accordingly.
- Enable the **Echo sent message to all node with same Group Address** in the gateway config-node, under advanded options.
## I SEE THE TELEGRAM IN ETS, BUT MY ACTUATOR WON'T REACT
You may have other Node-Red KNX Plug-ins installed.
- Remove all KNX Plugin from node-red Palette. Leave only knx-ultimate. Remember to remove the config nodes as well, they are hidden.
- If you have **an IP interface** try to disable the ACK by selecting _Suppress ACK request_ in the [Gateway configuration node](/node-red-contrib-knx-ultimate/wiki/Gateway-configuration).
## I CAN ONLY RECEIVE TELEGRAMS, NOT SEND - OR VICE VERSA
Your KNX/IP Router/Interface may have filtering active.
- Check in ETS if the router has filtering enabled. If yes, either allow **forwarding** in all configuration pages of your KNX Router, or change the physical address of the knx-ultimate config node according to your router's filter tables.
- If you're using **knxd** , please check the filtering tables and change the KNX config node physycal address accordingly.
## WRONG VALUES FROM THE NODE
- Make sure to use the right datapoint. For example, for temperature, use 9.001
- When possible, import the ETS csv file in the Gateway configuration node. You'lll have always the right Datapoints!
- Make sure not to have two or more knx-ultimate nodes, having **same Group Address ** but**different Datapoint** .
## IF I SEND A MESSAGE TO A NODE FROM NODE-RED, OTHER NODES IN THE FLOWS HAVING THE SAME GROUP ADDRESS, DOESN'T RECEIVE/DON'T REACT TO THIS MESSAGE
### This happens if you use a tunneling/unicast connection, like KNX/IP Interfaces or knxd does.
- Enable the **Echo sent message to all node with same Group Address** in the gateway config-node, under advanded options.
## DOES IT WORK WITH SECURE KNX ROUTER/INTERFACES?
Secure IP Router/Interfaces doesn't work if set to secure. It works, instead, if you allow unsecure connections to you router.
- Make sure to disable the secure routing or to allow unsecure connections.
- If you feel that you can be hacked, you can use a second ethernet card, straight connecting node-red machine to your KNX Router/Inteface with a dedicated LAN cable. In the knx-ultimate config node **Bind to local interface** option, you can then set this interface to be the default KNX/IP interface.
- Secure connection will be implemented one day.
## FLOOD PROTECTION KICKS IN. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
Flood protection avoids your node-red UI to become unresponsive, due to a too high amount of messages sent to te input pin of the node in a specified time frame of 1 second.<br/>
The max number of msg you can send to a node is 120 each second. If you need to send a lot of msg to the node, please consider a "delay" node, to delay each message a bit.<br/>
[See here](/node-red-contrib-knx-ultimate/wiki/Protections)
- Review your flow. Send less messages to the node or use a **delay** node.
- Use RBE filter, to discard messages having the payload equal to the current node's payload.
## I'VE IMPORTED ETS FILE BUT THERE ARE WARNINGS ABOUT DATAPOINTS
In a ETS installation, setting Datapoints is mandatory, at least for professional one.<br/>
With Datapoints, all youd visualization and control devices know how to handle the telegram and how to perform a right decondinf of values.<br/>
You'll see that ALL devices, control software, visualization systems and all the entire KNX world need Datapoints, so why not to thanks knx-ultimate, to force you to finally fix your ETS installation, that wait so long to be fixed? :-)<br/>
- Put an headphone on your head, with good music, open ETS and start adding datapoints.
- Or... import ETS file by selecting the option "if Group Address has no Datapoint", to "Import with a fake 1.001 datapoint (Not recommended)", or to skip affected datapoint.
- Remember to set the FULL datapoint (main type + subtype), otherwise the importer will set a default .001 subtype. Please see this image ![Subtype pic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Supergiovane/node-red-contrib-knx-ultimate/master/img/wiki/subtype.png)
## CIRCULAR REFERENCE PROTECTION KICKS IN. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
Circular reference protection avoids your node-red UI to become unresponsive and your KNX installation to be flooded, by disabling two nodes with same Group Address link toghether.<br/>
For example, if you link the **output ** pin of a node having Group Address 0/1/1, to the**input** ping of another node having the same Group Address 0/1/1, the protection will kicks in.<br/>
[See here](/node-red-contrib-knx-ultimate/wiki/Protections)
- Review your flow. Detach the two identical nodes or out something inbetween, acting as "moderator".
- Use RBE filter, to discard messages having the payload equal to the current node's payload.
## I'M STILL HAVING PROBLEM
### Use one of the channels below to reach me (i ever prefer gitHub)
- Open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/Supergiovane/node-red-contrib-knx-ultimate/issues). Whenever you open an issue, i receive an email and i can sort it out immediately.
- Send me a PM on [Knx-User-Forum](https://knx-user-forum.de). I'm here as TheMax74. Mein Deutsch ist nicht so gut, daher bitte auf Englisch schreiben!
