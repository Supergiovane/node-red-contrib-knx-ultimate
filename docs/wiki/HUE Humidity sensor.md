## Upgrade to KNX Ultimate 8

Version 7 adds a compact **Upgrade to v8** button at the top of every node editor. It backs up the flows, installs the required HUE/Matter packages, converts compatible nodes, performs a full Deploy, verifies the saved flows and installs version 8. Restart the Node-RED service when prompted; reloading only the browser is not enough. Legacy KNX AI nodes stop the automatic operation.

> **Deprecated:** this dedicated HUE node remains available for existing flows. Use **HUE Controller** for new work. It is marked `(deprecated)` in the palette and on the canvas, uses a lighter color than HUE Controller, and its editor opens with a migration notice. The high-contrast orange migration button with white text converts all legacy HUE nodes locally; afterwards it opens only an editable email draft. The email is never sent automatically. When the process finishes, a fixed Node-RED message remains visible until you click OK and offers an optional support button; the donation page opens only when that button is clicked.

This node reads relative humidity (%) from a Hue humidity sensor and maps it to KNX.
