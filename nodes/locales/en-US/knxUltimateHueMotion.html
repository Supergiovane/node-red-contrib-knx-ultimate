<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="knxUltimateHueMotion">
<p>This node listens to Hue motion sensors and mirrors their events to KNX (and optionally to Node-RED flows).</p>

Start typing in the GA field (name or Group Address) to link the KNX GA; matches appear while you type. Use the refresh icon next to “Hue sensor” if you add a new sensor on the bridge.

**General**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| KNX GW | KNX gateway that will receive the motion updates (required to reveal KNX mapping options). |
| HUE Bridge | Hue bridge that exposes the motion sensor. |
| HUE Sensor | Hue motion sensor to use (supports autocomplete and refresh). |

**Mapping**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Motion | KNX GA that receives `true` on motion detected and `false` when the area is clear. Recommended DPT: <b>1.001</b>. |

**Behaviour**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Node output pin | Show or hide the Node-RED output. When no KNX gateway is configured, the output pin stays enabled so Hue events still reach your flow. |

The KNX widgets are hidden until a KNX gateway is selected, helping you configure the node as a pure Hue -> Node-RED listener when needed.

### Output

1. Standard output — `msg.payload` (boolean)
: `true` when motion is detected, otherwise `false`.
