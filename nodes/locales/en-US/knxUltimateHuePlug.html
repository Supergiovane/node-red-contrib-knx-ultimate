<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="knxUltimateHuePlug">
<p>This node links a Philips Hue smart plug/outlet to KNX group addresses so you can control and monitor the on/off state directly from the BUS.</p>

**General**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| KNX GW | Select the KNX gateway used to exchange telegrams |
| HUE Bridge | Select the configured Hue bridge |
| Name | The Hue plug to control (autocomplete shows available plugs) |

<br/>

**Switch**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Control | KNX GA that sends the on/off command (typically DPT 1.xxx). The value is forwarded to Hue. |
| Status | Optional GA that receives the Hue plug on/off state. |
| Power state | Optional GA that mirrors the `power_state` reported by Hue (on/standby). Use a boolean/text DPT according to your needs. |

<br/>

**Behaviour**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Read status at startup | When *yes*, the node emits the current Hue plug state on deploy/reconnect. |
| Node I/O pins | Enable to expose Node-RED input/output pins. Inputs expect a payload compatible with the Hue API (e.g. `{ on: { on: true } }`). Outputs forward every Hue event to the flow. |

<br/>

**Notes**
- Commands are sent through the Hue v2 API (`/resource/plug/{id}`).
- The status GA is only written when a change is detected. If you need periodic refreshes, keep *Read status at startup* enabled and/or trigger a KNX read (the node replies using the last cached Hue value).
- Power state is reported as `true` when the bridge indicates `on`, `false` for `standby`/others.
