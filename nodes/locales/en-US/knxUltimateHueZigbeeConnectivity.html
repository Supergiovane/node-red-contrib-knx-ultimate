<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="knxUltimateHueZigbeeConnectivity">
<p>This node reports the Zigbee connectivity state of a Hue device to KNX and to your flow.</p>

Start typing the KNX device name or Group Address in the GA field; suggestions appear while you type. Press the refresh button beside “Hue sensor” to reload the device list from the bridge.

**General**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| KNX GW | KNX gateway that will mirror the connectivity status (required for KNX options to appear). |
| HUE Bridge | Hue bridge to query. |
| HUE Sensor | Hue device providing Zigbee connectivity information (supports autocomplete and refresh). |

**Mapping**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Status | KNX Group Address reflecting the connectivity state (`true` when connected, otherwise `false`). Recommended DPT: <b>1.xxx</b> boolean. |

**Behaviour**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Read status at startup | On deploy/reconnect read the current connectivity state and publish it to KNX. Default: “yes”. |
| Node output pin | Show or hide the Node-RED output. Without an active KNX gateway the pin stays enabled so events continue to reach the flow. |

KNX-specific widgets stay hidden until a KNX gateway is selected, which also allows you to use the node purely as a Hue → Node-RED monitor.

### Output

1. Standard output — `msg.payload` (boolean)
: `true` when the device is connected, `false` otherwise. `msg.status` contains the textual status (`connected`, `disconnected`, `connectivity_issue`, `unidirectional_incoming`).
