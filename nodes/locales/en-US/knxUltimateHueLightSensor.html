<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="knxUltimateHueLightSensor">
<p>This node publishes the ambient illuminance reported by a Hue light sensor to KNX and/or your Node-RED flow.</p>

It emits the lux value whenever it changes. Start typing in the GA field (name or Group Address) to link the KNX GA; matches appear while you type. Use the refresh button next to “Hue sensor” if you have just added a new device on the bridge.

**General**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| KNX GW | KNX gateway that receives the measured lux value (required to display KNX mapping fields). |
| HUE Bridge | Hue bridge the sensor belongs to. |
| HUE Sensor | Hue light sensor (supports autocomplete and refresh). |

**Mapping**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Lux | KNX GA that receives the lux value. Recommended DPT: <b>9.004</b> (lux). |

**Behaviour**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Read status at startup | On deploy/reconnect read the current lux value and send it to KNX. Default: “yes”. |
| Node output pin | Show or hide the Node-RED output. When no KNX gateway is selected the output pin stays enabled so Hue readings continue to reach your flow. |

The KNX-related widgets are hidden until a KNX gateway is selected, allowing you to use the node purely as a Hue → Node-RED illuminance feed if required.

### Output

1. Standard output — `msg.payload` (number)
: Current illuminance in lux.
