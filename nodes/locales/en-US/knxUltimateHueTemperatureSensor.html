<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="knxUltimateHueTemperatureSensor">
<p>This node reads the ambient temperature from a Hue sensor and forwards it to KNX (and optionally to Node-RED).</p>

Start typing in the GA field (name or Group Address) to pick the KNX GA; matches appear while you type. Use the refresh button next to “Hue sensor” if you add a new device to the bridge.

**General**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| KNX GW | KNX gateway that receives the temperature (required to reveal KNX mapping options). |
| HUE Bridge | Hue bridge hosting the temperature sensor. |
| HUE Sensor | Hue temperature sensor (supports autocomplete and refresh). |

**Mapping**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Temp | KNX GA that receives the temperature in °C. Recommended DPT: <b>9.001</b>. |

**Behaviour**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Read status at startup | On deploy/reconnect read the current temperature and send it to KNX. Default: “yes”. |
| Node output pin | Show or hide the Node-RED output. When no KNX gateway is selected the output pin remains active so Hue readings still reach your flow. |

KNX-specific widgets stay hidden until a KNX gateway is chosen, making it easy to use the node purely as a Hue → Node-RED temperature feed when required.

### Output

1. Standard output — `msg.payload` (number)
: Current temperature in °C.
