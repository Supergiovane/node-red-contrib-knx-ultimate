<p>Expose Hue scenes to KNX and optionally emit raw Hue events to the flow. The device list supports autocomplete; use the refresh button beside “Hue Scene” after adding scenes on the bridge.</p>

**General**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| KNX GW | KNX gateway that provides the group-address catalogue used in the Mapping tabs. |
| HUE Bridge | Hue bridge that hosts the scenes. |
| Hue Scene | Scene to recall (autocomplete; refresh button reloads the bridge catalogue). |

**Mapping tab**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Recall GA | KNX GA that recalls the scene. Use DPT 1.xxx for boolean control or DPT 18.xxx to invoke a KNX scene number. |
| DPT | Datapoint type used to recall the scene. Options include 1.xxx or 18.001. |
| Name | Friendly label for the recall GA. |
| # | Available when a KNX scene DPT is selected; choose the scene number to send. |
| Status GA | Optional GA that mirrors the active scene state (boolean). |

**Multi scene tab**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Recall GA | KNX GA using DPT 18.001 to select scenes by number. |
| Scene selector | Use the editable list to map KNX scene numbers to Hue scenes and choose whether to recall them as active, dynamic palette or static. |

**Behaviour tab**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Node input/output pins | Show or hide the Node-RED output pin. The pin remains forced on when no KNX gateway is selected so Hue events still reach the flow. |

> ℹ️ KNX-specific widgets remain hidden until a KNX gateway is selected. The editor also hides the Mapping tabs until both a Hue bridge and KNX gateway are configured.
