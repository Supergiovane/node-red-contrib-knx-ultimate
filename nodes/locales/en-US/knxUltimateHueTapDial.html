<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="knxUltimateHueTapDial">
<p>Maps the rotation service of a Hue Tap Dial to KNX and forwards the raw Hue events to the flow. Buttons on the device are handled by the <b>Hue Button</b> node. Use the refresh icon beside “Hue Tap Dial” after pairing a new device.</p>

**General**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| KNX GW | KNX gateway whose group-address list is used for autocomplete. |
| HUE Bridge | Hue bridge that exposes the Tap Dial device. |
| Hue Tap Dial | Rotary device to control (autocomplete; refresh button reloads the list). |

**Mapping**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Rotate GA | KNX GA that receives rotation events. Supports DPT 3.007 (relative dim up/down), DPT 5.001 (absolute level 0‑100%) or DPT 232.600 (vendor colour control). |
| Name | Friendly label for the KNX GA. |

**Behaviour**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Node input/output pins | Show or hide the Node-RED output pin. When no KNX gateway is selected the pin remains enabled so Hue events continue to reach the flow. |

### Outputs

1. Standard output
: `msg.payload` (object) the raw Hue event emitted by the Tap Dial.

> ℹ️ KNX-specific widgets are displayed only after a KNX gateway is chosen; the mapping tab is hidden until both bridge and gateway are configured.
