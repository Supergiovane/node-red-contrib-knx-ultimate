<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="knxUltimateHueBattery">
<p>This node exposes the battery level of a Hue device to KNX and emits events whenever the value changes.</p>

Start typing in the GA field (name or Group Address) to pick a KNX group; matches appear while you type. Use the refresh button beside “Hue sensor” to reload the list from the Hue bridge.

**General**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| KNX GW | KNX gateway used to publish the battery level (required to show KNX mapping options). |
| HUE Bridge | Target Hue bridge. |
| HUE Sensor | Hue device/sensor providing the battery measurements (supports autocomplete and refresh). |

**Mapping**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Level | KNX GA for battery percentage (0–100%). Recommended DPT: <b>5.001</b>. |

**Behaviour**
|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| Read status at startup | On deploy/reconnect, read the current battery level and publish it to KNX. Default: “yes”. |
| Node output pin | Show or hide the Node-RED output. When no KNX gateway is selected the output pin is enforced so events still reach the flow. |

The KNX mapping widgets are hidden until a KNX gateway is selected, preventing accidental edits when the node is used only with Hue outputs.
