<p>This node forwards events from a HUE button and maps them to KNX group addresses.</p>

Link the Group Adresses you want, to the respective events.  
All fields are optional.  
The <b>Toggle values</b> option is enabled by default. It toggles the mapped KNX values (true/false, increase/decrease dim).  
Start typing in the GA field, the name or group address of your KNX device, the avaiable devices start showing up while you're typing.
The Status fields need to be filled only if you set the _Toggle values_ option.  
This allows the internal logic to be aware of external devices, like wall switches.
