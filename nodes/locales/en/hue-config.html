This node registers Node-RED with the Hue Bridge and now handles the pairing handshake automatically.

Enter the bridge IP (or pick one from the discovery list) and click **CONNECT**. The editor will keep polling the bridge and closes the waiting dialog as soon as you press the physical link button. Use **CANCEL** if you need to abort the pairing and try again later. The Username and Client Key fields stay editable so you can copy or paste credentials at any time.

Already have credentials? Click **I ALREADY HAVE THE CREDENTIALS** to immediately show the fields and enter them manually without waiting for the bridge button.
